# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions are supported. Since bilderrahmen is dependency free, no security risks can come
from transitive dependencies

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You do not need to report anything. We have automated security scanning in progress.
Only devDependencies used for building the library are affected anyway.
